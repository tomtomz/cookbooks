{"name":"chef_zfs","version":"1.0.1","description":"Manage ZFS","long_description":"# chef_zpool Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef_zfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef_zfs) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/chef_zfs.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef_zfs)\n\nA resource for managing ZFS filesystems. This cookbook is forked from the original zfs cookbook by Martha Greenberg at <https://github.com/marthag8/zfs>.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Ubuntu\n- FreeBSD\n- Solaris\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Resources\n\n### zfs\n\n#### Actions\n\n- `:create`\n- `:upgrade`\n- `:destroy`\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `properties`: ZFS properties are set as an Array of Hashes to configure the filesystems using the single `properties` attribute.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Creating a ZFS Filesystem\n\n```ruby\nzfs \"tank/test\" do\n  properties [\n    { mountpoint: '/opt/test' },\n    { relatime: 'on' },\n    { compression: 'lz4' }\n  ]\n  action :create\nend\n```\n\n##### Upgrading a ZFS to the latest filesystem version:\n\n```ruby\nzfs \"tank/test\" do\n  action :upgrade\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\nzfs \"tank/test\" do\n  properties [\n    { mountpoint: '/opt/test' },\n    { relatime: 'on' },\n    { compression: 'lz4' }\n  ]\n  action [:create, :upgrade]\nend\n```\n\n##### Destroying a ZFS Filesystem\n\n```ruby\nzfs \"tank/test\" do\n  action :destroy\nend\n```\n\n:sparkles: Note that destroy flags are not directly supported. However, some like the `-d` flag can be used by setting the `defer_destroy` property on the filesystem prior to destruction. See the example below.\n\n```ruby\nfilesystem = zfs \"tank/test\" do\n  properties [\n    { defer_destroy: 'on' }\n  ]\n  action :create\n  only_if \"zfs list | grep -q #{self.name}\"\nend\n\nzfs filesystem.name do\n  action :destroy\nend\n```\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
