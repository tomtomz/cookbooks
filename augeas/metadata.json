{"name":"augeas","version":"0.5.4","description":"Installs/Configures augeas","long_description":"# augeas cookbook\n\n[Augeas](http://augeas.net/) is a library that allows files of different formats to be\nedited in a mostly generic manner.  It does this by using a `lens` to transform the file\ninto a generic tree like structure which can then be modified and transformed back into\nthe original format of the file.  This cookbook provides a resource that allows recipes to\nmodify files using augeas.\n\n# Requirements\n\nPlatforms:\n\n* RHEL Family\n* Debian\n* Ubuntu\n* FreeBSD\n\n# Resources and Providers\n### `augeas`\n\nThe `augeas` provider is used to make changes to files using the augeas library.\n\n#### Attributes\n* `changes`(required) - A string or list of strings that contain augeas commands to run\n* `lens`(optional) - A specific lens to use to transform the file being modified\n* `incl`(optional) - Only include the specified file in the augeas context. If this is set lens must also be specified.\n* `run_if`(optional) - Only run if the given augeas matcher is true\n\n#### Examples\n\nSet the sysconfig variable `TEST` in the `/etc/sysconfig/test` file to b\n```\naugeas 'sysconfig_test' do\n  changes 'set /files/etc/sysconfig/test/TEST b'\nend\n```\n\nIn the above case augeas already knows which lens to use to transform files\nin `/etc/sysconfig`. If it didn't we could tell it more explicitly like\n\n```\naugeas 'sysconfig_lens' do\n  changes 'set /files/etc/sysconfig/test/TEST b'\n  lens    'Sysconfig.lns'\n  incl    '/etc/sysconfig/test'\nend\n```\n\nI can also make changes conditionaly based on augeas match statements.  The following will set TEST to c only if it is currently set to a.\n\n```\naugeas 'sysconfig_get_equal_test' do\n  changes 'set /files/etc/sysconfig/test/TEST c'\n  run_if  'get /files/etc/sysconfig/test/TEST == a'\nend\n```\n\n# Recipes\n\n### augeas::geminstall\n\nThis recipe will install the augeas development libraries and then use `chef_gem` to\nmake the `ruby-augeas` gem available to the resource.\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: Nathan Huff (nhuff@acm.org)\nContributor:: Pierre Rambaud\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe interface for this resource is pretty much a copy of the Puppet resource of the same\nname.  While the code is rewritten the general flow of how it interacts with augeas is\nalso highly influenced by what the Puppet provider does.\n","maintainer":"Nathan Huff","maintainer_email":"nrhuff@umn.edu","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"rhel":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","freebsd":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"build-essential":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/nhuff/chef-augeas","issues_url":"https://github.com/nhuff/chef-augeas/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.1"]],"ohai_version":[]}
